# Fashion MNIST Classifier Using pytorch

This repo is a test for creating a classifier in pytorch

You can [download](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1P9r5HNlplpk-jv2jRfyiQKLgayLFYjes) and place the model inside the following folder:

```
model/resnet_classifier.pth
```

Or you can download from the fashion mnist and train yourself
[here](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist)

Do note: that fashion mnist dataset was build directly into torch vision,
i downloaded and converted the images without realizing. You can modify the code to work for only downloading at torch vision
